Using fullCalender
on frontend side using ReactJs and Backend apis are in nodeJs and database is MYSql
We have 2 main folder     
   1.) client
   2.) server

After downloading both the folder
Run the following command -
"npm install" then "npm start" in each folder 

Example -  
   react-express-mysql-calender/client =>  npm install then "npm start"    
   react-express-mysql-calender/server =>  npm install after it "npm start"
   
Our 2 server will start.

(i)  React(client) will run on PORT 3000 

(ii) NodeApi(server) will run on PORT 3001

User can login and logout and can insert event and delete event in calender
